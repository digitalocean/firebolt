# Elasticsearch

 ||||
 |--------------|:--------:|--------|
 | **Accepts:** | `elasticsearch.IndexRequest` | Index requests specify the document to index and the target index name |
 | **Returns:** |  `*firebolt.AsyncEvent`      | For successfully indexed events, returns the original event |


The `elasticsearch` node indexes documents to an Elasticsearch cluster.   Its parent node must return 
`elasticsearch.IndexRequest` structs containing - at a minimum - the document and target index name.

The IndexRequest type contains four fields:

| Field       | Required | Default | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------|:--------:|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Index       |    *     |         | Destination index name in Elasticsearch.                                                            |
| MappingType |          |         | In ES 7.x+, omit MappingType and ES will default to `_doc`.  In ES 6.x-, specify your mapping type. |
| DocID       |          |         | Provide a document ID to index this document under, or leave nil and ES will assign an ID.          |
| Doc         |    *     |         | The document to index.  This should be a struct that is marshallable to JSON.                       |

Internally, `elasticsearch` uses the `BulkService` in the `olivere/elastic` client.

## Configuration
